The code in this folder is a direct conversion to JavaScript of the Golang code by 
[Thomas Dybdahl Ahle](https://github.com/thomasahle) in
[https://github.com/thomasahle/numberlink](https://github.com/thomasahle/numberlink)
to be used via Nodejs or web page.

As much as possible, the JavaScript code follows the layout of the original Go code.
JavaScript naming conventions have been followed.

The functions in `stdlib.mjs` are converted from the Go standard library such as [Math.rand](https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/master:src/math/rand/rand.go) which follow the more open [BSD license](https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/master:LICENSE)

This version is licensed under the [GNU Affero General Public License v3.0](https://github.com/thomasahle/numberlink/blob/master/LICENSE) as requested by its original author.

(It is still a work in progress)
