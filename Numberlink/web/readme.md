The code in this folder is a direct conversion to JavaScript of the Golang code by 
[Thomas Dybdahl Ahle](https://github.com/thomasahle) in
[https://github.com/thomasahle/numberlink](https://github.com/thomasahle/numberlink)
to be used via Nodejs or web page.

As much as possible, the JavaScript code follows the layout of the original Go code.
JavaScript naming conventions have been followed and a few functions from the Go standard library have been provided.
